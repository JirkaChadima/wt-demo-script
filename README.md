# Winding Tree demo script

[This script](https://github.com/JirkaChadima/wt-demo-script/blob/master/index.js) is intended as a simple showcase of what
Winding Tree platform is currently capable of.

It uses only [@windingtree/wt-js-libs](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-js-libs/tree/proposal/next) showcases access to data stored on

- [https](https://github.com/windingtree/off-chain-adapter-http)
- [swarm](https://github.com/windingtree/off-chain-adapter-swarm)

You can easily verify by yourself that the hotel data is actually stored both on-chain and off-chain:

- https data: https://jirkachadima.cz/wt/hotel-data-index.json, https://jirkachadima.cz/wt/hotel-description.json
- swarm data: https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz-raw:/51faac7dc1cc1c35a7b2f95bbfa26b398e7b466bea98810665e85cecce5fcebc,
