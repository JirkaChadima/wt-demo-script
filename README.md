# Winding Tree demo script

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/JirkaChadima/wt-demo-script.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This collection of scripts is intended as a simple showcase of what
Winding Tree platform is currently capable of. It uses only
[@windingtree/wt-js-libs](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-js-libs/) with off-chain adapters:

- [https](https://github.com/windingtree/off-chain-adapter-http)
- [swarm](https://github.com/windingtree/off-chain-adapter-swarm)

You can easily verify by yourself that the transactions are actually
called [on-chain](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xB309875d8b24D522Ea0Ac57903c8A0b0C93C414A).
